# Intro into Full Stack Applications
## using React, Micro, & MongoDB

To begin working with this simple example you must first clone down the repo. You can omit **project-name** or replace it with any name you wish to provide, this will create the git repo on your machine with the provided name.

```
git clone https://github.com/helio-training/fsad-on-0618-fs-intro.git <project-name>
```
Once the application code is cloned to your machine, open a CLI and run the following in both the **API** and **UI** directories. 
```
npm install
```
